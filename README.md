## Description
The goal of this discord bot is to "verify" the age of any user who joins your discord server.
Features:
  - DM based interactions (no clutter or private info being sent to public channels)
  - Command based configs (allows server owner to configure the bot, using commands)
  - Ban & Role management


Tech Stack:
  - [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), an angular-like node.js framework. If needed, this can be used to run both the bot & a bot website in the same process.
  - [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) and ORM that is actually meant to be used in TS projects, with support for mongoDB!
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) via MongoDB Atlas (free)
  - [Discord.ts](https://github.com/OwenCalvin/discord.ts) A proper discord.js framework, but using Typescript & decorators!
